# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-01)

**Core value:** A single command gives developers a local Kubernetes cluster where LoadBalancer services, Gateway API routing, metrics, and dashboards all work without any manual setup.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-01 — Roadmap created, all 34 v1 requirements mapped to 7 phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Research]: Use Headlamp v0.40.1 instead of kubernetes/dashboard (archived Jan 2026, Helm dependency)
- [Research]: Embed all addon manifests at build time using go:embed (offline-capable, no external tools)
- [Research]: MetalLB must be fully ready before Envoy Gateway actions run (hard ordering dependency)
- [Research]: CoreDNS patching uses read-modify-write in Go, not kubectl patch (Corefile is a string blob)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: CoreDNS Corefile merge-patch strategy needs validation — string blob in ConfigMap, not structured YAML
- [Phase 5]: Confirm standard vs. experimental Gateway API CRD channel; measure binary size of ~3,000-line Envoy Gateway manifest
- [Phase 6]: Headlamp v0.40.1 static manifest URLs need verification before embedding
- [Phase 2]: Podman rootless MetalLB viability (L2 speaker + raw sockets) needs testing during implementation
